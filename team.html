      <h1>Meet Our Team</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">The people behind Ad-It</p>

      <img src="/blog/gaven-day-founder.jpg" alt="Gaven Day, Founder & CEO" class="founder-image">

      <h2>Founder & CEO — Gaven Day</h2>
      <h3>A mission-driven innovator combining technology, creativity, and faith</h3>

      <p>Gaven Day's journey to founding Ad-It is one shaped by resilience, faith, and an unconventional path through service, injury, reinvention, and breakthrough innovation.</p>

      <p>Before entering the world of technology, Gaven served in law enforcement, where a traumatic brain injury forced him to rethink his future and rebuild his life from the ground up. Determined not to let the injury define him, he shifted his focus to cybersecurity. Completing a bachelor's degree in <strong>Network and Cybersecurity from Green River College</strong> in just over two years, a pace driven by discipline, curiosity, and sheer resolve.</p>

      <p>But as graduation approached, the job market changed dramatically. Positions that had been plentiful a year before had dried up, and every opportunity seemed to evaporate just as he reached for it. Facing closed doors and growing uncertainty, Gaven turned to God and asked the question that shaped everything that followed:</p>

      <p class="quote">"Why bring me this far just to fail?"</p>

      <p><strong>The answer came in the middle of the night.</strong></p>

      <p>Gaven woke up in the middle of the idea... a vision of a platform that would change how creators and advertisers connect. A system that wouldn't interrupt people with ads, but instead empower users to monetize their content naturally and give brands a better way to reach audiences. That idea became the foundation of Ad-It.</p>

      <p>From that moment, everything accelerated. Gaven began mapping how the platform could come to life. But one truth quickly became clear: <em>he couldn't build this alone.</em></p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p style="margin:0;">Through what he credits as both hard work and prayer, the right team began to form at the right time: <strong>Henry, Trevor, Gustave, Fabrice, and Vance</strong> — each bringing specialized expertise that transformed Ad-It from an idea into a patent-pending technology.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Throughout this journey, Gaven experienced epiphany after epiphany while running, hiking, and spending time in nature. These moments of clarity helped shape Ad-It's architecture, its user experience, and its long-term vision.</p>

      <p>As a content creator himself, Gaven understands what everyday users want and what they dislike about today's goals to obtain monetization. As a consumer, he knows exactly where traditional ads fail and why people feel frustrated by intrusive or irrelevant content. This rare combination of <strong>technical insight, creator perspective, and consumer experience</strong> is what drives Ad-It's uniquely human-centered approach.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Today, Gaven leads Ad-It with a mission shaped by faith, purpose, and innovation:</strong><br>
        to build a platform that empowers users, elevates creators, strengthens brands, and redefines how advertising operates in the modern world.</p>
      </div>

      <p><em>Ad-It exists because one closed path opened the door to something far greater — and Gaven has been running toward that mission ever since.</em></p>

      <hr style="border: none; border-top: 2px solid #f0f0f0; margin: 3rem 0;">

      <img src="/blog/trevor-davidson.jpg" alt="Trevor Davidson, Co-Founder & COO" class="founder-image">

      <h2>Co-Founder & COO — Trevor Davidson</h2>
      <h3>Building disciplined execution through experience in law enforcement and real estate</h3>

      <p>Trevor Davidson came to Ad-It in a transitional season. After a significant business loss driven by a bad partnership, he found himself reevaluating his direction: not just financially, but personally. It was a moment defined by hard lessons and honest reflection, where he was actively asking God to reveal what should come next so he could move forward rather than stay anchored to a failed chapter.</p>

      <p>Professionally, Trevor operates in two demanding arenas. He serves as a <strong>Police Officer</strong>, a role that requires constant judgment under pressure, clear communication, and leadership in unpredictable environments. In parallel, he runs a fully active <strong>real estate business</strong>, both as a broker and as an investor. Together, these responsibilities shaped a mindset centered on systems, accountability, and execution in the real world.</p>

      <p>Ad-It entered the picture through a simple message from CEO and Co-Founder, Gaven Day. It wasn't a polished investor deck or a long-winded pitch. Gaven essentially asked if Trevor knew any software engineers who could help him build a product. Given the recent fallout from his prior business partnership and the seriousness of his existing roles, Trevor's first instinct was to set it aside. But as the day went on, the message stayed on his mind, and in light of the prayers he'd been praying for direction, he decided not to ignore it.</p>

      <p>Before introducing Gaven to anyone in his network, Trevor asked to see the product for himself. The concept and early demo made the opportunity obvious: <em>everyday people were creating value online without a clear path to monetize it, and Ad-It had a scalable way to fix that.</em> Trevor may not have known his exact role in that moment, but he knew two things right away, he wanted in and his experience was built for helping turn a strong idea into a real, growing operation.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p style="margin:0;">Trevor joined Ad-It as <strong>Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer</strong> to transform vision into disciplined execution. He now leads operations, systems design, and process development, applying the same standard he brings to policing and real estate: <strong>clarity, structure, and integrity under pressure.</strong></p>
      </div>

      <p><em>For him, Ad-It is more than a new venture — it is a deliberate next chapter built from experience, designed to give creators and entrepreneurs the leverage they've been missing.</em></p>

      <h2>Co-Founder & CTO — Gustave Mugabo</h2>
      <h3>Architecting scalable systems with deep expertise in distributed infrastructure and AI</h3>

      <p>Gustave Mugabo brings to Ad-It a rare depth of technical leadership shaped by years of building and scaling production systems in both enterprise and startup environments. As <strong>Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer</strong>, he is responsible for architecting Ad-It's technical infrastructure, ensuring every layer of the platform is designed for performance, security, and long-term scalability.</p>

      <p>Before joining Ad-It, Gustave built production-grade systems on <strong>Azure and AWS</strong>, working across distributed architectures, cloud-native services, and large-scale data pipelines. His experience spans <em>containerized microservices, CI/CD automation, real-time analytics, and event-driven systems</em> ; the foundational technologies that power modern platforms at scale.</p>

        <p style="margin:0;">Gustave's technical expertise extends deeply into the <strong>AI and machine learning space</strong>. He has hands-on experience working with modern ML and LLM frameworks, integrating AI workflows into cloud infrastructure, and designing systems that balance innovation with operational reliability.</p>
      </div>

      <p>What sets Gustave apart is not just his technical depth, but his clarity in communication and his commitment to mentoring the next generation of engineers. He understands that great systems are built by great teams, and he brings both the strategic vision to design Ad-It's architecture and the hands-on leadership to guide its execution.</p>

      <p>At Ad-It, Gustave is building infrastructure that doesn't just support today's product, but anticipates tomorrow's growth. His work ensures that as the platform scales, it remains fast, reliable, and secure for users, creators, and advertisers alike.</p>

      <p><em>For Gustave, Ad-It represents the convergence of technical excellence and meaningful impact — a platform where intelligent design meets real-world opportunity.</em></p>

      <h2>Co-Founder & CIO — Henry Shinas</h2>
      <h3>A partnership forged through shared purpose and unwavering commitment</h3>

      <p>Henry Shinas's journey to co-founding Ad-It began long before the company itself. He met Gaven in college by chance, sitting next to him in an identity and access management class. They hit it off immediately, discovering a natural synergy in how they worked. Their complementary skill sets and shared curiosity forged a strong friendship. Over time, they kept finding themselves in shared classes, each time gravitating toward one another, drawn together by how seamlessly they collaborated.</p>

      <p>As graduation approached, Gaven came to Henry with an idea rooted in resilience, faith, and a powerful sense of purpose. At first, he didn't reveal much, but having worked with him so closely, Henry could sense it was more than just a business opportunity; it truly felt like a calling. He was inspired by Gaven's drive and passion for a concept he barely understood, but years of friendship made him eager to be part of it, even before he grasped its full scope. <strong>Without hesitation, Henry told him he was one hundred percent by his side and would help in any way he could.</strong></p>

      <p>Once Gaven shared the full vision, Henry's faith and intuition drew him even closer to the idea. Gaven's commitment to empowering creators and transforming advertising resonated deeply, compelling Henry to help bring Ad-It to life. From that point on, they tapped their networks and doubled down on learning what it would take to develop this vision. In a surprisingly short time, they had assembled a dedicated, capable team ready to take on challenges side by side.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p style="margin:0;">As <strong>Co-Founder and Chief Information Officer</strong>, Henry plays a critical role in shaping Ad-It's information systems, data strategy, and operational intelligence. Supported by an exceptional team, Ad-It has grown from a midnight epiphany into a platform designed to connect, inspire, and innovate.</p>
