      <h1>The Founding Story of Ad-It</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">How a midnight spark became a breakthrough in AI-driven advertising</p>

      <img src="/blog/gaven-day.png" alt="Gaven Day, Founder of Ad-It" class="founder-image">

      <p>Ad-It began with an unexpected moment of clarity.</p>

      <p>One night, founder Gaven Day woke up in the middle of the night with a fully formed idea running through his mind — a vision of a platform where advertising didn't interrupt people, but lived naturally inside the content they already created. The concept was simple but revolutionary: <em>advertise through people, not to them.</em></p>

      <p>Unable to shake the idea, Gaven immediately began sketching out the foundations of what would become Ad-It — the workflows, the AI layers, the creator experience, the advertiser journey, the media analysis, the product placement engine. The more he planned, the clearer it became: Ad-It wasn't just another ad-tech idea. It was the future of how brands and creators would connect.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p style="margin:0;"><strong>But one truth became clear early on: no great product is built alone.</strong></p>
      </div>

      <p>As the scope of Ad-It grew, Gaven began assembling a team capable of turning this vision into reality. Piece by piece, the founding team came together — <strong>Henry, Trevor, Gustave, Fabrice, and Vance</strong> — each bringing their own expertise, perspective, and passion for innovation. Together, they transformed a midnight idea into a fully architected platform.</p>

      <p>With the team aligned and the product vision crystallized, Ad-It moved rapidly. AI pipelines were designed. Media analysis frameworks were built. Product placement models were refined. What started as a spark of inspiration evolved into a powerful, scalable engine for creator monetization and advertiser reach.</p>

      <p>Today, Ad-It is <strong>patent pending</strong>, the architecture is live, and the team is approaching the launch of the MVP, the first step in reshaping digital advertising and empowering creators worldwide.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p style="margin-bottom:0.5rem;"><strong>A middle-of-the-night thought became a mission.</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:0.5rem;"><strong>That mission became a team.</strong></p>
        <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Now, that team is building the future of advertising.</strong></p>
      </div>

      <p><em>This is the story of Ad-It — and we're just getting started.</em></p>
