      <h2>Founder & CEO — Gaven Day</h2>
      <h3>A mission-driven innovator combining technology, creativity, and faith</h3>

      <p>Gaven Day's journey to founding Ad-It is one shaped by resilience, faith, and an unconventional path through service, injury, reinvention, and breakthrough innovation.</p>

      <p>Before entering the world of technology, Gaven served in law enforcement, where a traumatic brain injury forced him to rethink his future and rebuild his life from the ground up. Determined not to let the injury define him, he shifted his focus to cybersecurity. Completing a bachelor's degree in <strong>Network and Cybersecurity from Green River College</strong> in just over two years, a pace driven by discipline, curiosity, and sheer resolve.</p>

      <p>But as graduation approached, the job market changed dramatically. Positions that had been plentiful a year before had dried up, and every opportunity seemed to evaporate just as he reached for it. Facing closed doors and growing uncertainty, Gaven turned to God and asked the question that shaped everything that followed:</p>

      <p class="quote">"Why bring me this far just to fail?"</p>

      <p><strong>The answer came in the middle of the night.</strong></p>

      <p>Gaven woke up in the middle of the idea... a vision of a platform that would change how creators and advertisers connect. A system that wouldn't interrupt people with ads, but instead empower users to monetize their content naturally and give brands a better way to reach audiences. That idea became the foundation of Ad-It.</p>

      <p>From that moment, everything accelerated. Gaven began mapping how the platform could come to life. But one truth quickly became clear: <em>he couldn't build this alone.</em></p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p style="margin:0;">Through what he credits as both hard work and prayer, the right team began to form at the right time: <strong>Henry, Trevor, Gustave, Fabrice, and Vance</strong> — each bringing specialized expertise that transformed Ad-It from an idea into a patent-pending technology.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Throughout this journey, Gaven experienced epiphany after epiphany while running, hiking, and spending time in nature. These moments of clarity helped shape Ad-It's architecture, its user experience, and its long-term vision.</p>

      <p>As a content creator himself, Gaven understands what everyday users want and what they dislike about today's goals to obtain monetization. As a consumer, he knows exactly where traditional ads fail and why people feel frustrated by intrusive or irrelevant content. This rare combination of <strong>technical insight, creator perspective, and consumer experience</strong> is what drives Ad-It's uniquely human-centered approach.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p style="margin:0;"><strong>Today, Gaven leads Ad-It with a mission shaped by faith, purpose, and innovation:</strong><br>
        to build a platform that empowers users, elevates creators, strengthens brands, and redefines how advertising operates in the modern world.</p>
      </div>

      <p><em>Ad-It exists because one closed path opened the door to something far greater — and Gaven has been running toward that mission ever since.</em></p>
